# Core Components and Practices of Spec-Driven Development

| Pillar or Concept | Description | Key Deliverables or Ingredients | Best Practices & Standards | Team Impact (Inferred) |
|-------------------|------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Context Engineering | The process of providing the AI with a structured technical background of the project to ensure deterministic and accurate code generation. | Tech stack versions, environment setup guides, Mermaid diagrams for data models, and API specifications. | Embed documentation within the codebase; use "RAG-on-the-fly" by referencing local spec files to minimize AI hallucinations. | Reduces onboarding time and ensures all AI-generated code aligns with specific project architectural constraints. |
| Spec Driven Development (SDD) | A paradigm shift where high-quality technical specifications allow the AI to handle the development process with high autonomy. | Technical tickets (Refined User Stories), pseudo-code definitions, unit test requirements, and mandatory documentation updates. | Explicitly define every step (e.g., security validations, commit formats) within the ticket to eliminate AI guesswork. | Increases team autonomy and consistency; enables junior developers to perform at a senior level via strictly defined technical paths. |
| Technical Standards & Conventions | Explicitly documented rules governing code writing, testing, and management to ensure systematic quality across the project. | Backend/Frontend standards (400–1000 lines), DDD principles, SOLID/DRY patterns, and Cypress/Playwright testing templates. | Use "Few-shot prompting" with concrete code templates; enforce English-only documentation to avoid non-deterministic language mixing. | Eliminates technical debt from inconsistent styles and ensures collective transformation rather than just individual productivity gains. |
| Workflow Definition | The mapping of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) from user story to production as a repeatable, robotic system. | Systematic process diagrams (Mermaid), definitions of "Excellent" for deliverables, and automated Git workflows. | Treat development as a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) style flow; define exact functions for Tech Leads vs. Developers. | Creates a "liquid team" capable of shifting between frontend and backend tasks (Full Stack) as the system guides execution. |
| Prompt Engineering | The conversational interface with AI agents that dictates output quality based on the precision of the input. | Advanced prompting techniques, expert-level personas, and pre-task clarification questions. | Use the assistant as an expert; mandate that the AI pose clarifying questions before starting a task to refine the scope. | Ensures high-quality, relevant AI outputs and reduces the need for repetitive task corrections across the developer base. |
| Co-pilot Selection | The strategic choice of AI coding assistants, prioritized by their integration capabilities rather than brand. | Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Claude Code, and JetBrains or VS Code integrations. | Focus on tools allowing terminal access to remain IDE-agnostic; leverage native Git integrations for automated Pull Requests. | Standardizes the toolset while allowing individual flexibility without compromising final output consistency. |
