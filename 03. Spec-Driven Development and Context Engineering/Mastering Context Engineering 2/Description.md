In this episode we talk about how to implement Spec-Driven Development to boost engineering productivity with artificial intelligence. It highlights that providing deep technical context is often more important than crafting complex prompts, since modern AI models can follow simple instructions effectively when they are properly informed.

The approach recommends integrating tools such as Jira, Figma, and Context.dev through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) so the AI can access user stories, interface designs, and precise library versions. It also encourages the use of meta-prompts and expert-style questioning techniques that push the AI to detect ambiguities before generating code.

This structured methodology aims to achieve pixel-perfect interfaces, stronger security practices, and more reliable results through automated analysis and background agents. Overall, it presents a shift for developers from manual coding toward a higher-level architectural and oversight role supported by AI-driven context.
