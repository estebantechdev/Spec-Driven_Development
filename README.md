# Spec-Driven Development

🛠️ A practical guide and reference for Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

Spec-Driven Development (SDD) is a methodology where clear technical specifications act as the single source of truth for building software. This repository provides structured explanations, templates, real-world examples, and step-by-step workflows to help teams design, implement, and validate projects using specification-first practices.

It is intended for developers, architects, technical writers, and AI-assisted teams who want to improve consistency, traceability, and code quality by aligning documentation, testing, and implementation under a unified specification process.
