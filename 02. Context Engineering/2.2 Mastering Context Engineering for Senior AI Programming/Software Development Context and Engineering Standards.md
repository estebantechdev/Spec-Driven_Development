| Technical Specs      | Technology Stack, Development Environment, and Architecture | Hexagonal Architecture or DDD (Domain-Driven Design)     | Provide detailed instructions for starting the environment from scratch, seeding databases with specific examples, and folder structure definitions. | README.md including architecture overview, technologies list, file structure, and setup instructions. | Must reference specific documentation files rather than inferring patterns from existing code to ensure consistency. | Expert Architect: Prepare high-level project overview and repository structure.     |
| Backend Development  | ORM usage, API standards, and Database patterns  | OpenAPI Spec, REST API conventions, and SOLID principles | Validate inputs for security (SQL Injection, XSS), manage environment variables, and follow error logging protocols. | API Spec (OpenAPI), Data Model documentation with Mermaid diagrams, and Backend Standards document (>1000 lines). | Act as a “Super Senior” agent, adhering strictly to the provided standards regardless of the user's seniority level. | Backend Developer: Ensure all endpoints follow documented security and performance standards. |
| Testing & QA         | Unit tests, Integration tests, and QA automation | TDD (Test Driven Development) and Playwright for E2E testing | Run tests before every commit; all new features must meet a minimum of 90% code coverage. | QA E2E reports, Unit test suite reports, and updated Testing Standards document.        | Verify that tests fail initially (TDD), program functionality, and issue a report confirming the 90% coverage requirement. | QA / Developer: Create the test suite, run full suites, and emit success reports before merging. |
| Workflow & Security  | Git Workflow and Security by Design              | Git branching patterns (Rebase vs Merge) and CORS/XSS security practices | Follow a documented SDLC blueprint; update technical documentation after every task completion. | Git workflow documentation, branch naming conventions, and Security-by-design checklists. | Follow the “Definition of Done” checklist, including code delivery, documentation updates, and test verification. | Team Lead / Product: Define the “Definition of Done” and verify completion of the development cycle. |
