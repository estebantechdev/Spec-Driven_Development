# The Context Engineering Glossary

## Glossary of Context Engineering and AI-Assisted Development

This glossary defines the key terms used in the context of Context Engineering and AI-assisted development.

### Core Concepts

- **Context (Contexto):**

  The essential information that allows an AI to understand the specific business, project, and standards of a team. It is considered the most important pillar for ensuring the AI behaves as expected and produces consistent results.

- **Context Engineering:**

  The practice of systematically providing AI with technical specifications and workflows to ensure it acts as a senior developer and follows specific team standards.

- **Technical Specifications (Especificaciones Técnicas):**

  Documentation that defines the tech stack, architecture, file structure, data models, and design patterns (like SOLID or Clean Code) used by a team.

- **Workflow (Flujo de Trabajo):**

  Also referred to as a blueprint or Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), this is the documented process of how a team moves from a requirement to production, defining phases and responsibilities.

### Development Standards & Tools

- **API Spec (OpenAPI):**

  A standard for documenting APIs to ensure they are consistent and visible to frontend developers, external teams, and even non-technical stakeholders.

- **Architecture (Hexagonal / DDD):**

  Specific architectural patterns (Hexagonal Architecture or Domain-Driven Design) that dictate how files, repositories, services, and controllers are structured.

- **Definition of Done (DoD):**

  A systematic checklist of requirements—such as updated documentation, unit tests, and code—that must be met before a developer or AI can consider a task complete.

- **Mermaid:**

  A visual representation tool used within documentation to create diagrams (like data models) from text, helping both technical and non-technical people understand the system.

- **TDD (Test Driven Development):**

  A workflow requirement where tests must be written and verified as failing before the actual code is programmed.

### AI Interaction Techniques

- **Agent (Agente):**

  An AI persona (e.g., an “expert architect”) configured with specific context to perform specialized tasks like writing code, documentation, or tests.

- **Few-shot / One-shot Prompting:**

  A technique where the user provides the AI with one or more examples or templates (like a README index) to ensure the output matches a desired format exactly.

- **Seniority Leveling:**

  The process of using shared context and expert agents to allow junior developers to produce code and documentation at the same quality level as a senior developer.

### Security & Quality

- **Anti-patterns (Antipatrones):**

  Specific bad practices in coding or testing that are documented so the AI knows exactly what to avoid.

- **Security by Design:**

  The practice of documenting security standards (e.g., handling SQL injection, CORS, or cross-site scripting) so that the AI incorporates them directly into the code.

- **Test Coverage:**

  A quality metric (e.g., a minimum of 90%) that the AI must meet and report on before finishing a task.
