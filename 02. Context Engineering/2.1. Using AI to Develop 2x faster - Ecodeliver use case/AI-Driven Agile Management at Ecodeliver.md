# AI-Driven Agile Management at Ecodeliver

Ecodeliver uses AI to streamline the process of managing their Jira boards, transforming what used to be a time-consuming, manual task into an automated workflow. According to the sources, the process involves the following:

- Generating User Stories and Tasks: The AI takes project requirements and translates them into user stories and specific Jira tasks. This is particularly helpful for "mechanical" tasks that previously required developers or managers to set aside an entire afternoon to complete.

- Organizing Epics: The AI helps in organizing these tasks into epics, providing a high-level structure to the project management process.

- Defining Acceptance Criteria: Beyond just naming tasks, the AI generates detailed acceptance criteria for each story, ensuring that the requirements for completion are clearly defined.

- Context-Based Customization: To ensure the output matches the team's standards, they provide the AI with context from existing tasks. This allows the AI to learn their specific writing style and organizational preferences, resulting in tasks that are consistent with how the team usually operates.

By using AI for these administrative tasks, Ecodeliver significantly reduces the "mental load" on the leadership team and saves a substantial amount of time that would otherwise be spent on manual documentation.
