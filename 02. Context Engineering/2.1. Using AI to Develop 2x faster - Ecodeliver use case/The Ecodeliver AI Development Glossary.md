# The Ecodeliver AI Development Glossary

## Glossary of Key Terms and Tools in Ecodeliver's AI-Enhanced Development Workflow

- **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  A set of predefined requirements that must be met for a user story to be considered complete. Ecodeliver uses AI to automatically generate these for their Jira tasks.

- **Ardu Pilot:**  
  A large-scale, open-source autopilot software for drones. It is used as an example of a “massive codebase” containing over 17,000 files, which Ecodeliver navigates using AI indexing.

- **Atlassian Suite:**  
  A collection of project management and collaboration tools that includes Jira. Ecodeliver uses this suite to manage their development pipeline.

- **C4 Diagrams:**  
  A specific type of architectural diagram used to visualize software systems. Ecodeliver generates these via AI to save time on manual drawing.

- **Codebase Indexing:**  
  The process where an AI tool (such as Cursor) analyzes and “learns” every file in a project. This allows developers to ask questions about the entire project’s logic instead of searching manually.

- **Cursor:**  
  An AI-powered code editor that indexes entire codebases. Ecodeliver uses it to find specific logic in large projects and to perform inline code modifications or commenting.

- **Doxygen:**  
  A tool used to generate documentation from annotated source code. Ecodeliver uses AI to write comments that follow this standardized style to automate their documentation process.

- **Epics:**  
  High-level project containers in Jira that house related user stories and tasks. AI helps Ecodeliver organize their work into these categories.

- **GPT-4:**  
  An advanced AI model used by Ecodeliver for research, technology comparisons (using its internet browsing capabilities), and as an “expert consultant” for documentation.

- **Jira:**  
  A project management tool used to track tasks and progress. Ecodeliver uses AI to automate the “mechanical” task of creating Jira tickets from requirements.

- **Mermaid:**  
  A tool and Markdown-based language that renders text into diagrams. Ecodeliver uses it to create editable architecture schemas that can be quickly modified by AI.

- **Tech Stack:**  
  The combination of programming languages and technologies used by a company. Ecodeliver’s stack includes TypeScript, Node, and Python.

- **Unit Tests:**  
  Automated tests that verify a specific piece of code works as intended. Ecodeliver uses AI to generate these tests based on existing project context and company procedures.

- **User Stories:**  
  Descriptions of software features from the end-user’s perspective. Ecodeliver uses AI to transform raw requirements into these stories for project management.

- **Zod:**  
  A TypeScript-first schema validation library. Ecodeliver uses AI as an interactive manual for this library, asking specific implementation questions instead of reading the full documentation.
