# The AI-Driven Development Blueprint at Ecodeliver

## How Ecodeliver Uses AI to Accelerate Development

How the startup Ecodeliver utilizes artificial intelligence tools to accelerate their development process by approximately 50% across several key areas:

### 1. Research and Architectural Design

- **Technology Comparison:**

  AI is used to perform initial searches and comparisons of new technologies (e.g., observability tools for Kubernetes) tailored to their specific tech stack, which speeds up the decision-making process.

- **Diagram Generation:**

  They use AI to create Mermaid or C4 architecture diagrams. These are generated as editable code, allowing for quick modifications and reducing the time spent manually drawing complex systems.

- **File Structure Planning:**

  Once an architecture is defined, the AI suggests a project folder and file structure based on the diagrams, which helps automate the creation of boilerplate configuration files and modules.

### 2. Project Management and Documentation

- **Automated Jira Tasks:**

  AI helps transform project requirements into user stories and Jira tasks. By providing context on how the team usually writes tasks, the AI can generate acceptance criteria and organized epics, saving hours of manual administrative work.

- **Interactive Documentation:**

  Instead of reading through entire manuals, developers use AI as an expert consultant for libraries like Zod. They provide documentation URLs to the AI and ask specific implementation questions to get immediate, actionable code examples.

### 3. Development and Codebase Navigation

- **Codebase Indexing:**

  For massive projects (like Ardu Pilot with over 17,000 files), tools like Cursor index the entire codebase. This allows developers to ask where specific logic is located, saving significant time that would otherwise be spent manually searching through unfamiliar directories.

- **Automated Commenting:**

  AI can document files by following the project's existing style (e.g., Doxygen headers). This ensures consistent documentation practices without burdening the developers.

- **Test Generation:**

  Developers use AI to create unit tests by providing the existing codebase and test structures as context. This makes the mechanical task of writing tests faster while ensuring they follow company procedures.
