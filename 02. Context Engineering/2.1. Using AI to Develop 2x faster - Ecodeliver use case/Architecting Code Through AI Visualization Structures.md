# Architecting Code Through AI Visualization Structures

In the Ecodeliver workflow, Mermaid and C4 diagrams are primarily used during the research and architectural design phase to visualize system structures and bridge the gap between planning and implementation.

Their use involves several key steps:

- Initial Visualization: Developers use AI to generate these diagrams (such as for the architecture of a Telegram bot) to avoid the time-consuming task of manually drawing them.

- Iterative Design and Editing: Because Mermaid and C4 are generated as editable code, they are easy to modify. For large or complex diagrams, the team finds it significantly faster to ask the AI to update the code than to make manual adjustments themselves.

- Defining Project Structure: Once the architecture is finalized through these diagrams, they serve as the context for the next development step. The team provides the Mermaid or C4 diagram to the AI to request a recommended project folder and file structure.

- Automating Boilerplate: This process helps define how to organize folders and automatically generate the necessary initial configuration files and modules for a new project or feature.

By using these diagrams as "code-based" representations of architecture, the team reduces the "mental load" of administrative tasks and accelerates the transition from a conceptual design to a functional codebase.
