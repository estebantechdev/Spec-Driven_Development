| Open Spec        | Open Source Community           | Greenfield and Brownfield (Existing projects)             | Handles incremental changes (deltas); reflects updates in the "source of truth" documentation; low overhead. | Simple but powerful; balanced mix between functionality and ease of use.       | Maintains a "source of truth" that evolves with the codebase.                 |
| "Custom" AI Specs  | Teamwork member(s)              | Tailored to specific team workflows; Backend/Frontend focus | Simplified SDD version; uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) to connect to Jira; includes prompts for enriching user stories. | Lite version; very easy to adapt and configure to measure.                     | Markdown-based (often in a specific folder) and integrated with task managers like Jira/Linear. |
| Kiro             | LIDR (Alvaro Moya) | Optimized for high traceability; early precursor to SDD copilots | Focuses on self-contained and exhaustive specs; creates documentation within the repo for history and traceability. | Simple start for a copilot specifically designed for SDD protocol.            | Self-contained specifications integrated into the repository.                 |
| Spec Kit         | GitHub (Microsoft)              | Greenfield (0 to 1) projects                               | Deeply integrated with GitHub Copilot and VS Code; structures tasks and creates projects from scratch. | Relatively complex for existing projects; not recommended for Brownfield due to folder/logic structure. | Structured files and folder-based task management.                             |
| BMAT             | BMAT Core                       | Large-scale, complex projects requiring high customization | Multi-agent orchestration (7+ agents); flexible and polyvalent workflow; highly customizable. | Over-engineering for basic needs; very complex to start; high maintenance overhead. | Technical contracts with extensive folder structures and multi-agent workflows. |
