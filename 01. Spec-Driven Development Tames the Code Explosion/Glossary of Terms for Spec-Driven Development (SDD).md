# The Lexicon of Spec-Driven Development

## Glossary of Terms for Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

- **Atomic Ticket:**  
  A task that is as small and isolated as possible, focusing on one single thing to ensure better traceability and fewer errors when processed by an AI.

- **Backbot:**  
  A tool or feature used to detect bugs or data corruption within a Pull Request (PR) before it is merged.

- **BDD (Behavior-Driven Development):**  
  A testing and development format, such as Gherkin, used to define acceptance criteria and usage cases in natural language.

- **Brownfield Project:**  
  An existing project with a complex codebase, potentially consisting of hundreds of thousands of lines of code, where new features are added incrementally.

- **Definition of Done:**  
  A set of exhaustive criteria, including error handling, documentation, and testing requirements, used to validate the quality of a completed task.

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):**  
  An architectural pattern used to separate code into distinct layers, such as controllers, services, routes, and validators.

- **Gherkin:**  
  A specific BDD language format used to explain usage cases and testing scenarios clearly.

- **Greenfield Project:**  
  A project that is starting from scratch (0 to 1), where the structure and logic are defined from the beginning.

- **Happy Path:**  
  Test scenarios that validate the successful execution of a feature when everything works as expected.

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol):**  
  An integration tool that allows AI agents to connect to external systems like Jira (Gira), Slack, or the local codebase.

- **PRD (Product Requirements Document):**  
  An extensive and exhaustive document that details the “why” and “what for” of a specific functionality. It describes what a feature consists of, including its flows, interfaces, and everything expected to be achieved through its implementation.

- **Sad Path:**  
  Test cases focused on error handling and system resilience, ensuring the software handles failures or invalid inputs correctly.

- **Single Source of Truth:**  
  The formal and clear specification that acts as the absolute reference for designing, implementing, and validating the entire system.

- **Spec-Driven Development (SDD):**  
  A methodology where formal specifications serve as the technical contract and “truth” to guide AI-human co-design, implementation, and validation.

- **Technical Contract:**  
  An exhaustive agreement (often reaching 1,000 lines) between stakeholders and developers that specifies implementation steps, acceptance criteria, and non-functional requirements like security and performance.

- **Traceability:**  
  The ability to track the logic, plans, and changes made by an AI within the development flow, often saved as documentation directly in the code or repository.

- **User Story:**  
  A description of a feature from the user's perspective, which in SDD is often refined and enriched by AI into a highly detailed technical ticket.
